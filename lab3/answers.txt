sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It take less time to do the sorting when the files is almost sorted but to compare with others algorithms, it take the most time.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It had taked same time to sort the random and almost sorted files. Also in reversed file it take more time to sort. Compare others algorithms, it take the lowest time to do the sorting.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: The almost sorted files also take time to sort. That mean it will also do the same steps with others files.
